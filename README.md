# JS_DRUNKIT_APP

JavaScript DrumKit it's really fun to play and when you hit the shown keys on your screen.

It's going to play the sound that's associated with that key and second of all it's going 
to do this short little animation where it pops the button up to be a little bit bigger than 
we want and then also it will apply that yellow border and that little background there it's 
really really subtle and I'll show you how that's working here we inspect on this kick one 
right here you see we have this datedash key and we'll look at that in just a second but 
when I press it.
